The data will be input from a file named “data.txt”. There will be an arbitrary number of lines in the file.
Each line will contain two double values separated by a space. These two values together will
form a point in (x,y) form. A sample input file is provided for your convenience. You are required
to do the following tasks:
1. Plot the points on a graph.
2. Fit a first-order curve and plot it on the graph. Print values of relevant parameters for the
curve and the corresponding value of correlation coefficient (r).
3. Fit a second-order curve and plot it on the graph. Print values of relevant parameters for the
curve and the corresponding value of correlation coefficient (r).
4. Fit a third-order curve and plot it on the graph. Print values of relevant parameters for the
curve and the corresponding value of correlation coefficient (r).
