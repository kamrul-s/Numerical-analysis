ln  (1+x) function can be expanded  using Taylor series and the expanded series is given below.
 
Now write a single program to perform the following tasks:
a.Take the value of x and iteration (number of terms) number n and return the approximated value of  ln(1+x).							

b.Plot the ln(1+x)  function for the interval -1<x<=1 with step size 0.1 using the built-in log (x) function.														
c.In the same plot (one plot for 1(a) and 1(b)) show five approximated functions for the same interval using different number of terms (1, 3, 5, 20, 50).						

d.Draw another plot showing the relative approx. error for each iteration while determining the value of  ln(1.5) upto 50 terms
