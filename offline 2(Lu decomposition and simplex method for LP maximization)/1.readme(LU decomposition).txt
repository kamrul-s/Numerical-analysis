LU DECOMPOSITION



The format of the input file in1.txt will be as followed:
Line 1 will contain an integer n, denoting the number of variables and equations in the set of
equations where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. After that, there will be n lines each containing n double values
separated by a space. These n lines constitute the A matrix. Then, there will be n lines each
containing a double value. These n lines constitute the B matrix.
All outputs (print statements for this assignment) must be in a file named out1.txt. Outputs
printed in the console will not be considered for evaluation. The format of the output file will be
as followed:
First n lines should contain n double values each separated by a space. These n lines should
constitute the L matrix.
A blank line should be printed after that.
Next n lines should contain n double values each separated by a space. These n lines should
constitute the U matrix.
A blank line should be printed after that.
If there is no unique solution for the set of equation, print “No unique solution” (without the
quotes) and terminate the program. Otherwise, there should be n more lines containing a
double value in each line. These n lines constitute the Y matrix.
A blank line should be printed after that.
Next n lines should contain a double value in each. These n lines should constitute the X
matrix.
