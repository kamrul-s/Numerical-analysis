You need to implement simplex method for maximization problem only. So, you have to
consider only the “less than or equal to” inequality relations.
(ii) You must take input from a file named “in2.txt”. The input file must reside in the same
directory as that of your python script. The structure of the input file is described below-
<Coefficients of Objective function>
<Constraints>
<Constraints>
…
<Constraints>
 The first line will contain the coefficients of the variables in the objective function. If we
have n variables, then this line should have n values (can be float) in a space separated
manner.
 Then there will be m lines for the m “less than or equal to” constraints. Please note that,
no input is necessary for constraints like X1 ≥ 0. For this assignment, you can assume
that, these constraints are present by default.
 Each of these m lines will have n + 1 values (n values for the coefficients of each
variable and 1 value for the right hand side) in a space separated manner. For example,
for a constraint X1 + 3X2 ≤ 15, the input line should be “1 3 15” (For two variables). For a
constraint X2 ≤ 10, the input line should be “0 1 10” (For two variables).

OUTPUT
(i) You must output the tableu of each step. The precision of the double values should be upto 2
decimal places after the decimal point. You can output in the console or in a file, which ever one
you prefer. (16 marks)
(ii) You must output the maximum value of the objective function along with the corresponding
value of the variables.
